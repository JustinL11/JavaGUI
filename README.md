>#### ***Purpose***

Code written in Java that takes a text file from user and outputs
how many times words appear within the text file using GUI

>#### ***Organization***
<br>
Main.java <br>
Hash.java <br>
controller.java <br>
GUI.java <br>
HashTest.java<br>

test.txt<br>
<br>

>#### ***How to use***
<br>

**Main.java** is where our GUI will be called.

**Hash.java** houses all out functions where it takes input text files from the user and parses all the strings into a hashmap.

**controller.java** is our main implementation of our GUI. 

**GUI.java** Implements J-Frame and houses our interface. 

**HashTest.java** Used to test Hash class.

**test.txt** Test case file used for our HashTest class for Junit.

>#### ***Design Notes***

This project serves to practice common Java Testing practices as well as learning how to implement basic GUIs.

**command prompt**

    Within command prompt, User may call "Javac Main.java" to compile the file
    Call "Java Main" to run the program, If Javac didn't fail to compile

    User will be prompt with a GUI to pick a file

    Outfile will have results of the sort.
